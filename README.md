## Solution

* In the first step, the basic network is built with all working parts of the network.
* In the second step, the model is changed to have a total number of parameters near to our target total parameters. Here the model is very near to our final architecture.
* In the third step, the model is finalized and regularization techniques are added to have better training results. Target of 99.40% accuracy with <10k parameters was achieved in this step.
* In the fourth step, the model is tweaked further for lowering parameters using the same architecture. Target of 99.40% accuracy with <8k parameters was achieved in this step.

Details of all steps are mentioned below.
