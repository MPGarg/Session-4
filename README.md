## Solution

* In first step, basic network is built with all working parts of network. 
* In second step, model is changed to have total number of parameters near to our target total parameters. Here model is very near to our final architecture.
* In third step, model is finalized and regularization techniques are added to have better training results. Target of 99.40% accuracy with <10k parameters was achieved in this step.
* In fourth step, model is tweaked further for lowering parameters using same architecture. Target of 99.40% accuracy with <8k parameters was achieved in this step.

Details of all steps are mentioned below.
